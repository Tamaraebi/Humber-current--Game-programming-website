                <P>Graduates of Humber’s Game Programming advanced diploma know how to program and design game engines for the purpose of game development, from indie to AAA. Over their three years in the program, graduates worked on team projects using programming tools to develop, test and maintain game applications through the practice of theories of usability, information architectures, network architecture and industry standards of practice. They studied a variety of topics, including C++ programming, graphics, mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence, Unity/Unreal game engine development, and computer networking.Graduates have experience collaborating with peers from related programs — such as Visual and Digital Arts, and Animation - 3D — to build high-quality assets for use in the games they developed.
